            There are many things to do in the city of Mos Eisley. From shopping in the  local marketplace &ldquo;Tatooine Traders,&rdquo;<img src="Assets/Shopping District.jpg" alt="shops" width="237" height="123" class="img_right_float"> enjoying one of  the many spa available for you or your droids, or passing your time away in one  of the many cantinas filled with colorful characters. Tatooine  has lots of activities for adults and children alike.<br>
            <img src="Assets/tumblr_m1ifgk1rUa1qzibiyo1_500.gif" width="384" height="153" alt="podrace"><br>
            Now that there is a stronger Imperial presence here  on Tatooine you can enjoy many activities outside of  the city as well, such as bungee jumping into the<a href="Assets/Sarlacc1.jpg"> Great Pit of Carkoon</a> or watching the Pod Races through the outlying  canyons. Or if you&rsquo;re feeling lucky you might want to try <a href="Assets/Jabbas_Palace.jpg">Jabba&rsquo;s  Palace</a>; the largest casino from here to Coruscant. <br>
            <br>
            On the outskirts of town you can find the<img src="Assets/tumblr_mfasylD9xh1ruox2ao1_500.jpg" alt="jawa" width="299" height="205" class="img_left_float"> Jawa&rsquo;s Traveling Droid Market. One the number one reason travelers  come to Tatooine is for the droid shopping. No one is  sure when or why it started, but Tatooine is the galaxies  #1 used-droid dumping ground. Ships just fly by and dump unwanted droids from a  low-orbit and then jump back into hyperspeed for  deep-space. The Jawas scour the desert for junk  droids, fix them up and sell them for the lowest prices in all the 15 kingdoms.<br>
            <br>
            The Foamwander Spa is a  great place to bring the droids you just purchased from the Jawa  for a memory wipe and an oil bath. While your droids are relaxing at the Foamwander Spa, you can go next door to the Hutt Chuba&rsquo;s restaurant and enjoy the house specialty Wortt Stew.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to hear some live music as you enjoy a  drink try Chalmun&rsquo;s Cantina at 3112 Outer Kerner Way.  <img src="Assets/mos-eisley.jpg" alt="poster" width="346" height="315" class="img_right_float">Mingle with spacers and smugglers and listen to the fascinating stories they  tell! Or just find a quiet booth and enjoy the planet&rsquo;s most popular group, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes. And,  if you&rsquo;re feeling particularly crazy, enjoy their house drink, the Bantha Blaster: a pink and green alcoholic drink that  fizzes and pops, even after you drink it!<br>
            <br>
            If you are visiting us during the fourth klekket, you should definitely rent a Landspeeder  and check out the great Bantha migration. Just  remember that while the increased patrols by the <img src="Assets/tumblr_n31rrplbLn1qidzizo1_500.jpg" width="376" height="232" alt="walkers">Imperial Walkers have made it  safe to venture out that far during the day, make sure you make it back before  dark.<a href="http://starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/tuskenraiders/"> The Tusken Raiders</a> (or Sand People as they  known locally) will definitely be coming out at night to round-up a couple of Banthas for transportation. <br>
            <img src="Assets/fauna-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-10-awesome-cre-L-GRt4Hl.jpeg" width="640" height="274" alt="bantha"><br>
            Another fun planetary past time is to rent a T-16 Skyhopper and fly to Beggar&rsquo;s Canyon<img src="Assets/Beggers Canyon.jpg" alt="beggar's" width="300" height="193" class="img_right_float"> to take out some womp rats. While you&rsquo;re out there don&rsquo;t forget to thread  the needle. <br>
            <br>
            Or, if you just want to take it easy you can always rent  a party skiff and do some of the best sunbathing in the galaxy, courtesy of our  lovely twin suns. Just don&rsquo;t forget to find a peaceful place to watch the most  spectacular sunset in the galaxy. <br>
            <br>
            On Tattooine you can find  or do just about anything you want. And we do mean anything. </p>
